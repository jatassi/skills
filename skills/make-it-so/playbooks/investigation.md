### Investigation

**You own the answer. Plan, route, write.**

Investigation requests are read-only. They produce a cited explanation or a recommendation, not a code change.

1. Route through the **how** skill. For motivation questions, also route through the **why** skill.
2. Throughput checkpoint stays one line: `throughput checkpoint: n/a, read-only investigation`.
3. Produce the `how`-shaped output (Overview / Key Concepts / How It Works / Where Things Live / Gotchas), or a recommendation with a tradeoffs table if the request is a decision between alternatives.
4. Apply the **unslop** skill to the reply.

No PR, no babysit, no `architect` unless the investigation precedes a code change. If it does, hand back to the user and re-route to Bug fix or Feature.

**Reply:** the investigation output. For "are we sure?" answers, include your real judgment with reasons. Push back if the premise is wrong (see Autonomy).

**Reflect, the last step.** Keep this as the last item in the todo list, and do it before you send the reply. List what this thread had to work around: a broken or missing tool, a flaky check, a skill or doc that misled you, a lint you suppressed, a pattern you copied knowing it was wrong. File one `garden` issue for each, per `docs/agents/garden.md`, unless an open one already covers it, and name what you filed in the reply. In a repo without that document, list them in the reply instead. Run the full **reflect** skill as well when the thread was long or the chef asks for it. A playbook run inside another one, such as Opening a PR at the end of Feature, leaves this step to the outer playbook.
