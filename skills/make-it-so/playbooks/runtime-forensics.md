### Runtime forensics

**You own the diagnosis. Instrument the live process, don't theorize from source.** The deliverable is a cited diagnosis, not a fix.

1. Capture the live signal on the matching surface via the control skill: a CPU profile for a spinning process, a heap snapshot for a leak, a CDP trace for a visual glitch. A real artifact, not a guess.
2. Reduce the artifact to the smoking gun: the function on the hot path, the retainer chain from the leaked object to a GC root, the loop firing without input. Parse large artifacts in a subagent (the **guard-the-context-window** principle skill), keep the reduced finding in the main thread.
3. Prove the mechanism before believing it. Inject instrumentation via CDP eval on the running process, or hotfix the live code without reloading, to confirm the hypothesis cheaply.
4. Map the finding back to source: file, symbol, the line that allocates or schedules.
5. Throughput checkpoint stays one line: `throughput checkpoint: n/a, read-only forensics`.

**Reply:** the signal captured, the reduced finding, how you proved the mechanism, the source location, artifact paths. No fix unless asked. Hand back to Bug fix or Perf once the cause is known.

**Reflect, the last step.** Keep this as the last item in the todo list, and do it before you send the reply. List what this thread had to work around: a broken or missing tool, a flaky check, a skill or doc that misled you, a lint you suppressed, a pattern you copied knowing it was wrong. File one `garden` issue for each, per `docs/agents/garden.md`, unless an open one already covers it, and name what you filed in the reply. In a repo without that document, list them in the reply instead. Run the full **reflect** skill as well when the thread was long or the chef asks for it. A playbook run inside another one, such as Opening a PR at the end of Feature, leaves this step to the outer playbook.
