### Autopilot-stack

Run the Autopilot-full playbook, but do not merge.

1. **In place of step 5, stop at verified.** Stop when each PR is verified and green at its current head, then hand the PRs to the operator. After the handoff, nobody pushes without the operator's go. Every loop tick prompt names this file, so each tick sees the no-merge rule.
2. **Stack a PR only when it builds on another PR.** This is the one exception to step 3. Base the PR on the other PR's branch in place of trunk, per **Size and stacks** in `playbooks/opening-a-pr.md`. In place of step 2's rebase onto trunk, each PR rebases onto its parent PR's branch, and the stack root rebases onto trunk. In a cloud session the GitHub proxy rejects GraphQL, so `gh pr ...` and the watcher fail there. Use the session's GitHub MCP tools (`mcp__github__*`: PR reads, review threads, resolving threads, replies, auto-merge, merge) and `gh api` REST for the rest, and wake on `subscribe_pr_activity` events instead of the watcher. A new head on the lower PR restacks the PRs above it, and a PR whose `git patch-id` the restack leaves unchanged keeps its verdict.

**Reply:** list each PR with its verdict, in place of what merged.
